# hofmod-types

A [hof](https://github.com/hofstadter-io/hof) module
for generating types in all languages
from a CUE based source of truth.


### todo

- datamodel history support
- links / copy of notes about complexities
- support both DSL and incomplete CUE?
	- by transforming / enriching CUE into DSL
	- might be best to (1) prototype (2) wait for new builtins (3) advocate for filling any gaps (4) possibly punt on a lot of things, or do this in Go? (but then our users are locked into a pre-defined schema)
